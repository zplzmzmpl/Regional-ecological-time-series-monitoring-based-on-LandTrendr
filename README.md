  - *you'd better know what's meanings of these parameters before run it, following below intro:*
    | **Parameter**          | **Type**          | **Default** | **Definition** |

    | spikeThreshold         | _Float_           | _0.9_       | Threshold for dampening the spikes (1.0 means no dampening)|
    | vertexCountOvershoot   | _Integer_         | _3_         | The inital model can overshoot the maxSegments + 1 vertices by this amount. Later, it will be prunned down to maxSegments + 1                      |
    | preventOneYearRecovery | _Boolean_         | _false_     | Prevent segments that represent one year recoveries                                                                                                |
    | recoveryThreshold      | _Float_           | _0.25_      | If a segment has a recovery rate faster than 1/recoveryThreshold (in years), then the segment is disallowed                                        |
    | pvalThreshold          | _Float_           | _0.1_       | If the p-value of the fitted model exceeds this threshold, then the current model is discarded and another one is fitted using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer|
    | bestModelProportion    | _Float_           | _1.25_      | Takes the model with most vertices that has a p-value that is at most this proportion away from the model with lowest p-value                      |

  ## ü§ñSTEP 3: Time Series Clustering
  In this step we use **KShape**[^3] algorothm to achieve our ts data clustering. Before we begain, we'd better know what's **KShape**?
  
  The KShape clustering method is a clustering algorithm based on time series data. It groups time series into different clusters by calculating the similarity between them. The key to the KShape clustering method is to match the shape of the time series, not just the numerical value. This enables KShape to discover time series that have similar shapes but not necessarily similar values. The KShape clustering method has wide applications in data analysis in various fields, including finance, medical and weather prediction.The basic steps of the KShape clustering method include:
  - Select the time series data set to cluster.
  - Calculate the similarity between time series, usually using methods such as dynamic time warping (DTW).
  - Clustering based on similarity, commonly used methods include k-means algorithm.
  - Analyze the clustering results and perform further interpretation and application as needed.

  **There are two ways to use KShape by `python`**
- KShape integrated in tslearn(only CPU engage in calulation)
  there is a simple example:
  
  	  from tslearn.clustering import KShape
	  def kshape_cpu(X, k):
	    print('begin kshape....\n')
	    seed = 0
	    ksc = KShape(n_clusters=k, n_init=5, verbose=True, random_state=seed)
	    ksc.fit(X)
	    print('\nend kshape\n')
	    return ksc


- Independent KShape lib(you can call GPU to accelerate calculation efficiency)
   there is a simple example:

	   from kshape import KShapeClusteringGPU
	   def kshape_gpu(X,k):
	     print('begin kshape gpu...\n')
	     ksg = KShapeClusteringGPU(n_clusters=k)
	     ksg.fit(np.expand_dims(X, axis=2))
	     print('\nend kshape gpu...')
	     return ksg
  
before we run KShape code, we need to define fixed number of clustering, for this we use **Elbow Law** to check probable number of clustering.

       distortions = []
       for i in range(4, 8):
           print('cluster num:', i, '\n-------------')
           ks = KShape(n_clusters=i, n_init=5, verbose=True, random_state=0)
           # Perform clustering calculation
           ks.fit(X)
           distortions.append(ks.inertia_)
        plt.plot(range(2, 7), distortions, marker='o')
        plt.xlabel('Number of clusters')
        plt.ylabel('Distortion')
        plt.show()
  
  code above will return a plot like this, you can see *slop* become more gentle when value of *x* equal 5, so we confirm number of clustering is 5
  <p align="center">
    <img width='500' height='400' src="https://i.postimg.cc/ydNRrcHn/2.png">
  </p>

  but sometimes it is doesn't obvious just by this way, so we suggest use `yellowbrick` lib to visualize k-elow-law:
	
 	from yellowbrick.cluster import KElbowVisualizer	
	#Instantiate the clustering model and visualizer
	model = KShape(n_init=1, verbose=True, random_state=0)
	
	#distortion: mean sum of squared distances to centers
	#silhouette: mean ratio of intra-cluster and nearest-cluster distance
	#calinski_harabasz: ratio of within to between cluster dispersion
	
	visualizer = KElbowVisualizer(model, k=(4,10),metric='distortion')
	
	visualizer.fit(img_data)        # Fit the data to the visualizer
	visualizer.show()        # Finalize and render the figure
  
  now we can apply KShape to image data we got above with 51 bands, you can just cluster ***Univariate*** data, also you can cluster ***Multivariate*** data.
  
  **First of all, read data and convert to fomat of time series.**
  - for univariate data clustering, like ndvi ts data [length(number of ts), time_span(51 for this), var(1 for this)]

	    import rasterio
	    #Load the .tif image
	    with rasterio.open("/content/NDVI51years_median.tif") as src:
	        image_data = src.read()
	        row = image_data.shape[1]
	        column = image_data.shape[2]
	        # Reshape to (rows, columns, bands)
	        transposed_image_data = np.transpose(image_data, (1, 2, 0))
	
	    print('transposed shape:', transposed_image_data.shape)
	
	    #Reshape the image data to (rows * columns, bands)
	    img_data = transposed_image_data.reshape(-1,transposed_image_data.shape[2])
	    print('reshaped shape:', img_data.shape)

  - for multivariate data clustering,like [ndvi, tcg, tcw] ts data [length(number of ts), time_span(51 for this), var(3 for this)]
    
		import rasterio
		import numpy as np
		from rasterio.transform import Affine
	
		#define image paths
		image_paths = [
			    '/*/*/*/ndvi51years_median.tif',
			     ¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑
			    '/*/*/*/tcw51years_median.tif'
			]
		#read image data and reshape to 4D array
		combined_array = []
		for path in image_paths:
	    	with rasterio.open(path) as src:
	        	array = src.read()
	        	reshaped_array = array.reshape(array.shape[0], -1)
	        	combined_array.append(reshaped_array)
	        	if path == image_paths[0]:
	          		metadata = src.profile
	          		print(metadata)
	
		#convert list to array
		combined_array = np.array(combined_array)
	
		#transpose array to fomat as requires
		combined_array = combined_array.transpose(2, 1, 0)
	
		print(combined_array.shape)
		#save as npy file, you will don't need to read raster data again and again
		np.save("/*/tsdata_samples_51_3.npy",combined_array)
	
	 	#save metadata
		with rasterio.open('/content/drive/MyDrive/metadata.tif', 'w', **metadata) as dst:
	    		dst.update_tags(**metadata)
**now see the result after kshape clustering(univariate for left and multivariate for right)ü•≥**

    <img width='300' height='300' src="https://i.postimg.cc/T1hp091g/2.png" hsapce='10'>
  </p>

**but nowüòï, another question is how to evaluate accuracy of kshape clustering‚ùì**

*alas, tslearn does not seem to provide an evaluation method for KShape clustering. so we recommend you **modify the source code** to achieve it, more information click [here](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_37960007/article/details/107937212). let's see how to realize it. Officially, three similarity measures, dtw-dba, softdtw, and Euclidean distance, are provided in tslearn, but nothing about KShape clustering. Notice that source code, there `metric="precomputed"`, indicates that a user-defined distance metric is provided, which is good, and then the key to evaluating KShape using **`silhouette_score`** is here:*

*here is needed information about `silhouette_score`:*
it is an indicator that measures the tightness and separation of clustering results. It is based on the distance of each sample to other samples within the cluster to which it belongs and the distance to samples in the nearest cluster. The value range of the silhouette coefficient is between [-1, 1]. The closer the value is to 1, the better the sample clustering is. The closer the value is to -1, the worse the sample clustering is.

- Positive value: indicates that the samples are clustered well, and the intra-cluster distance is closer than the inter-cluster distance.
- Negative value: indicates that the samples are poorly clustered, and the distance within clusters is farther than the distance between clusters.
- Close to 0: It means that the distance between samples within and between clusters is similar, and the clustering result is unclear.


*here is e.g. of how to use silhouette_score calculation function `silhouette_score(cdist_dtw(X),y_pred,metric="precomputed")`, so you need to figure out what is `cdist_dtw(X)`‚ùî. Actually realname of it, is measuring distance of time series, different from `Euclidean`, `dtw` and `softdtw`. so here is definition of SBD which is foundation of kshape.*

$SBD(\vec{x},\vec{y})=1-\max_{w}\left(\frac{CC_w(\vec{x},\vec{y})}{\sqrt{R_0(\vec{x},\vec{x})\cdot R_0(\vec{y},\vec{y})}}\right)$

so we add the `_get_norms` function, which is responsible for calculating the modulus length, and the `_my_cross_dist` function, which returns the distance matrix of the temporal collection X, i.e., the matrix formed by the distance between each element ti in X.

	def _get_norms(self,X):
	    norms = []
	    for x in X
	        result = numpy.linalg.norm(x)
		norms.append(result)
	    norms = numpy.array(norms)
	    return norms
	
	def _my_cross_dist(self,X):
	    norms = self._get_norms(X)
	    return 1.-cdist_normalized_cc(X,X,norms1=norms,norms2=norms,self_similarity=False)

*after this we test how it work*ü§Ø

	import numpy as np
	from tslearn.generators import random_walks
	import tslearn.metrics as metrics
	from tslearn.clustering import silhouette_score
	 
	def test_kshape_silhouette_score():
	    seed = 0
	    num_cluster = 2
	    ks = KShape(n_clusters= num_cluster ,n_init= 5 ,verbose= True ,random_state=seed)
	    X = random_walks(n_ts=20, sz=16, d=1) * 10
	    #generate label radomly
	    y_pred = np.random.randint(2, size=20)
	    dists = ks._my_cross_dist(X)
	    #set diagonal elments to zero
	    np.fill_diagonal(dists,0)
	    #calculate silhouette score
	    score = silhouette_score(dists,y_pred,metric="precomputed")
	    print(score)
       >>>output:0.026772646

**now, part of time series clustering is done. if you have interest about it, you also can try kmean‚ûïdtw‚ûïdba or kmeans‚ûïsoftdtw. it's similar workflow. good lucküòÜ**

## üôâSTEP 4: Time Series Classification

- **prepare training data**
  
  generate training data according to paper[^2]:
  
  <p align="center">
    <img width='700' height='900' src="https://i.postimg.cc/J4wFjj8v/2.png">
  </p>

  - (1) The sample point was disturbed during the study period but not restored and failed to exhibit vegetation recovery. It is classified as DN and its NDVI values oscillate below the vegetation threshold after a sharp decrease (a).
  - (2) The sample point was disturbed during the study period and was still recovering at the end of the study period. It is classified as DR1 and its NDVI values decline sharply from a vegetated to a non- 
  vegetated state, then increase gradually to a state of less than-full recovery with an upward trend in last several years (b).
  - (3) The sample point was disturbed during the study period and exhibited vegetative stability but did not exhibit full recovery. It is classified as DR2 and its NDVI values decline sharply from a vegetated to a non-vegetated state, then increase gradually to a vegetated status with NDVI values lower than pre-disturbance but with little change in last several years (c).
  - (4) The sample point was disturbed during the study period, was restored to be stable, and exhibited full vegetation recovery. It is classified as DR3 and its NDVI values decline sharply from a vegetated to a non-vegetated state, then increase gradually to a vegetated status that is approaching or exceeding pre-disturbance with little change in last several years (d).
  - (5) The sample point was disturbed prior to the study period and exhibited recovery but did not exhibit a stable state. It is classified as BD1 and its initial NDVI values of pixels are lower than the 
  vegetation threshold but then increase gradually to a level that is no less than the vegetation threshold with an upward trend in last several years (e).
  - (6) The sample point was disturbed prior to the study period was restored to be stable. It is classified as BD2 and its initial NDVI values are lower than the vegetation threshold but then increase gradually 
  to a level that is no less than the vegetation threshold with little change in last several years (f).
  - (7) The sample points exhibited disturbances two or more times (g and h). They are classified as CD, meaning that they had complex disturbance histories.
